[[review]]
text = '&hellip; _incredible resource for architects, art and architectural historians and enthusiasts_. Until I received the book, it was unimaginable that any single book could include the _diverse vernacular architecture styles_ of a large country like India&hellip; that this book is a product of _several decades of painstaking documentation_ also means that many of these buildings no longer exist. It is a _must have for every architect and architecture school_ and for anyone interested in Indian Heritage.'
