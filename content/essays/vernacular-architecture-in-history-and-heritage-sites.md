Though not much remains of residential dwellings in historical times, archaeological
excavations and Indian art history give many clues about the vernacular architecture in those
times. The excavation reports of Mohenjodaro, Taxila, Sikrap and other sites mention very
orderly planning of structures in the towns. Visible today in the excavations at Dholavira are
remains of residential dwellings in circular and rectangular designs, complete with stepwells
and water storage tanks.

Caves, in particular in western India, are all that remains of the earliest monumental
architecture, of which vihara caves were used for residences by Buddhist monks, apart from
chaitya or prayer hall caves, with elaborate stone carvings and paintings as at Ajanta. The
circulation spaces were according designed and the chaitya caves had large front windows
with wooden screens to let the light in to the inner recesses of the caves.


The materials used in historical vernacular buildings were mud and burnt bricks, timber,
stone, bamboo, thatch and tiles. Timber seems to be the primary material, but nothing
remains of the wood-cutting and joinery techniques except what is visible in the caves of
Karle, Kondane and Bedsa, which show that wood-crafting techniques had reached a very
high level of perfection. Some of these caves, which were constructed 1500 to 2000 years
ago, still have the wooden ribbed ceiling of exceptionally well crafted teak members, without
the use of nails.

That wood was predominantly used for construction, whether residential or
monumental, is very obvious because even when temples and caves were carved out of stone,
the eaves and ceilings had replica beams and rafters carved out of the stone, as would have
been done in wooden structures, even though they were not required structurally. The earliest
Buddhist caves of India at Barabar, near Gaya, also have the granite material of the caves at
the entrance carved into the form of wooden rafters and purlins. Since wood was not in short
supply at that time, it appears that this was done because the artisans were so used to using
wood that even when working with stone they fashioned it that way. Another reason could
be that they wanted to make structures of a more permanent nature – stone instead of wood
– but wanted to give it the same form of wooden structures.

Till recently, in parts of southern India, intricate wood based designs were still living
traditions like in the nalukettu vernacular houses and these are also found in the stone
temples of some centuries ago, indicating a continuing link between stone and wood
construction techniques.

Clues of earlier construction techniques exist not just in cave and temple architecture but
even in the wall paintings depicted at Ajanta, Badami and Bagh. The murals depict elegant
palaces and residences with graceful columns and beams, comfortable spaces, pavilions with
steps and grand structures with huge gates. The popular theme of Lord Buddha departing
from the gates of the palace are done in different styles. Even though compressed into two
dimensions the proportions seem just right. In one painting at Ajanta, Buddha is sitting
in an elaborate pavilion and is being bathed by disciples. In another painting, under a
pavilion two lovers are sitting. The capitals of some of the columns are painted in turquoise
colours, probably derived from minerals. Other paintings illustrate multi-coloured tents, and
stockades, apart from a rich array of people dressed in the best silk textiles of India, including
tie-and-dye, brocades, muslin and ikats. Hardly noticed by scholars, the Ajanta murals also
contain peculiar stone building blocks depicted behind the subjects in three-dimensions.
The Ajanta and Bagh mural themes are Buddhist but even in the earliest Hindu murals at
Badami caves, though fragmentary, the column elements are the same, as also in the Jain wall
paintings at Ellora. This indicates that the vocabulary of architecture was similar in the major
religions, centuries ago.

The skills that were used to construct these cave residences were advanced even by present
standards. The earliest caves of Barabar (300 BC) carved out in a granite mountain have a
surface finish that still shines as if it was made yesterday. This finish is up to about standing
height and above that the chisel marks used to cut the cave are still visible, the delineation
between the two being clearly visible. Even the grand Ajanta caves have an unfinished vihara
cave which shows the manner in which the rock was excavated and it appears like the work is
going on and the artisans have just gone for a break!

Another source of imagery for early Indian architecture are structures depicted in Indian
sculptures from Bharut, Sanchi, Sannati and other sites which date back to more than 2,000
years. Each site has its own details but the underlying style remains the same. Depicted are
palaces, forts and also huts of common people of the times in forests. Groups look down
from multi-storeyed balconies on activities and celebrations below. Soldiers march in and
out of gates and Lord Buddha’s departure from the palace remains a favourite theme. The
Bharut sculptures have graceful chaitya windows that give a very airy feel. The Sannati stupa
excavation is particularly interesting as it was made during the times of Emperor Ashoka and
one sculpture has an image of him.
