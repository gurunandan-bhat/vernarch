Vernacular architecture can best be defined as indigenous architecture of a people or locale,
based on social and environmental needs and preferences, and made from locally available
building material with available skills. It would include not only individual structures but
collective areas like the pols of Ahmedabad and other areas of Gujarat or the mohallas of cities
of northern India – complete facilities for the inhabitants, which could be group or caste
specific. The concentric temple towns of the south are other such clusters. Within a repetitive
format of a community template though, there was sufficient room for individual expression.

Environmental extremes in India also necessitate diverse vernacular forms to adapt to the
climate and season excesses – from dry deserts to a long, humid, coastline, the lofty and
heavily forested Himalayas and other lesser mountain ranges (Aravalli, Nilgiri, Sayadhari),
and the Deccan plateau – with climates varying from temperate to tropical and with rainfall
varying from almost nil to heavy. Diverse occupations also require corresponding local
designs of houses according to professional needs. Local vernacular construction of a few
decades ago was not an isolated development but a part of the craft-guilds’ output, which
included other crafts in the village community which catered to all the needs of society.

Urban and village definitions of settlements became contiguous in cities like Delhi and even
in the days of Aurangzeb the traveller Francois Bernier wrote of Shahjahanbad as a collection
of many villages. There is also, thus, a close physical link between the two – the old and the
new forms, both often existing next to each other.

Vernacular architecture is essentially ‘architecture without architects’, as there were no formal
architects earlier but mainly artisan guilds and master masons. Not much is known of the
master builders of vernacular as well as monumental architecture. Vernacular buildings had
sutradhars who were not architects in the modern sense of the word but master masons. Some
monuments, however, do record and even illustrate the builders of monuments, like the
victory tower in Chittorgarh which includes a sculpture of the master designer and his family
and assistants. Overall vernacular architecture was based on vastu and shilpa shastras. Unlike
as in residential architecture, detailed plans were made for larger monuments, the likes of
which can still be seen carved on stones near the Bhojpur temple, Madhya Pradesh.

It is only natural that builders in Bikaner and Jaisalmer would use stone since it is abundant
there, while in Bengal, lacking stone, bamboo and bricks were used. The Gangetic plains
had to use mud (at times combined with wattle), clay and rubble or bricks. Timber was
the natural material for the Himalayas and coconut palms in southern India. Laterite is the
preferred material in regions of the south where it is abundantly available. The more welloff
would, naturally, try to bring in outside inputs to set them apart from the rest. Climatic
requirements, too, would be different for different regions of India – desert and pasture-lands
of Kachchh, tropical and temperate regions, the Himalayan and other ranges, the Deccan
plateau and the southern states. In the extreme heat of northern India, inverted pots were put
not only on roofs but even under intermediate floors, for heat insulation.

Changes in the environment and needs of the inhabitants would also provide impetus
for structural change of residences. External influences would also modify the vernacular
styles like the advent of colonial architecture by the British and their neglect of traditional
building forms. Many years down colonial rule, the British did realize that they, perhaps,
could and should have encouraged the use of vernacular skills and designs. A group was
set up to explore what skills remained in the then Indian building industry and decorative
methods that could still be used, but by then it was too late. (Sanderson, Gordon, Begg, J.
and Marshall, J.H., Types of Modern Indian Buildings at Delhi, Agra, Allahabad, Lucknow,
Ajmer, Bhopal, Bikaner, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur, with notes on the craftsmen
employed on their design and execution, A.S.I., Government Press, Allahabad, 1913.)

Vernacular architecture also evolves and adapts continuously. The term vernacular is relative
and not absolute. Thus, the modern flats and apartments of today might be the vernacular a
century from now. Similarly, in a metropolitan city cement might be more readily available
locally than bamboo or earth. Unfortunately, the term vernacular is also associated with
something primitive and backward.

Looked from a view of sustainability rather than just nostalgia and historical interest,
vernacular design is evoking interest for sustainable habitats, as formally ratified by Agenda
21 of the 1992 Earth Summit at Rio De Janeiro. The international follow up body for this
was the Commission on Sustainable Development, setup in 1992 by the UN. These concepts
of sustainable settlements were further stressed by the UN conference on Human Settlements
at the world summit on sustainable development that took place in Johannesburg in1996.
With no need now for natural climate adjustment in summer with the use of airconditioners,
climate has become less of an issue in house design and construction. It is
a different matter that it puts a greater demand on non-renewable energy resources and
pollution from coal-based thermal plants.

Though smaller in scale than the much larger monumental buildings, vernacular residential
structures share some common building elements with them, influenced by inputs from
conquering dynasties and colonial rulers. The decorative aspects also draw on the craft
traditions of the area subject, of course, to the community – whether Hindu or Islamic, with
the latter’s ban on depiction of anthropomorphic forms. On the other hand monumental
architecture also borrowed elements from vernacular structures like the bamboo eaves of the
humble bangla hut. The lifetime of the residential structures ranged from huts that served
its purpose for a cycle of seasons only before they were flattened by the elements to more
permanent structures like havelis and mansions.

It is not necessary to simply preserve and imitate vernacular buildings in toto – which might
be impractical at present – but to understand the processes involved in their construction.
Many architects and enthusiasts have successfully imported vernacular elements in their
designs which are well suited for current sustainable practices. Many such examples have
been illustrated in contemporary books and resources listed in the bibliography.
Though all the styles of vernacular structures were eminent with features that make them
attractive even today, not all vernacular forms are great or relevant now – like the Shekhawati
murals in the courtyard houses on every square inch of houses, or the stepwells which, over a
period of time, became sources of guineaworm and other diseases.

There has been a renewed interest in vernacular and traditional structures in the world
and architects who have made a reputation in using vernacular forms and features include
Hasan Fathy, Geoffery Bawa, Louis Kahn and many others, including Laurie Baker in
India. Worldwide interest in vernacular building traditions has also resulted in research
and resources relating to such structures, including the barn of North America and other
notable vernacular residential architecture, some of which are UNESCO world heritage
sites like those of the Asante of Ghana, those in the M’zab valley of Algeria and the Sukur
cultural landscape, Nigeria. Old city centres like Naples, Shibem in Yemen certainly have a
community feeling that modern buildings lack.

Not many ancient remains of complete houses have been found preserved in great detail
like at Pompeii. Some structures have been identified in excavations of the Indus Valley
civilization, which is the start of the period of the use sun-dried and fired bricks. Even in
monumental architecture stone-work started in Ashoka’s period and prior to that both
domestic and monumental architecture must have been mainly wood. This is proved by the
depiction of wooded beams and rafters in some rock-cut caves in Ajanta, in stone itself. The
Karli, Bhaja and Kondane caves still retain their original wooden ribs that were put there for
no structural reason but possibly only because of the heavy influence of wood as a building
material in those times in non-cave structures.

Like the last wave of modern palaces, architecture prospered when there were no wars
and under the complete rule of the British, especially after the 1857 struggle for freedom
from colonial rule and till the upheavals of Partition in 1947. Under British rule, though
extraneous inputs started coming, the wealthy could build more lavish residences than they
could under native rulers as now there was no problem about attracting undue attention
from the ruler. The British even standardized the size of bricks as 9x4.5x3 inches. Prior to that
thin nanak-shahi bricks were used in the country and locally made clay drain-pipes.

Mohenjodaro and Harappa used gypsum plaster and use of lime came later, and its use spread
particularly after Muslims came to India. Later on, around the eighteenth century, lime
stucco-work became popular amongst the wealthy wherein it was mixed with marble powder
and given a smooth polish. Where available, timber and timber bonded structures were made,
the wood usually being deodar in the hills and teak in the plains like Gujarat, or even coconut
trees in Kerala. In between, in the foothills of northern India, saal or Shorea robusta was a
good general purpose timber. In the north-east bamboo was ideal material to use for structures
and when split its parts could be woven into a screen. Thatch roofing was generally used for
huts. Relatively newer materials were glass for windows and corrugated iron. In the absence of
availability of glass earlier, shells were put in a cluster in windows in the coastal areas and the
buildings of Goa still retain them where they serve the purpose of present-day frosted glass in
a natural manner.

The main vernacular form was the courtyard house, which was a remarkable form of
residential architecture. The courtyard was this style’s quintessence and its relevance to the
home was apparent as well subtle. It was the structure’s core. The courtyard ordered other
spaces by context in an abode where space was not rigidly fixed but could be adaptable
depending on the time of day, season and exigency. It obliquely controlled the environment
inside and served the needs of its inhabitants. Its moods changed with varying degrees of
light and shade, and with them the ambience of the abode. Centrally located, it imprinted
the domain of the dwelling like a visual anchor. Around this courtyard space the rest of the
structure seamlessly coalesced by the play of epistyles and gallery spaces. It was the spatial,
social and environment control centre of the home.

This form of architecture met with the requirements of the traditional joint family system as
well as the climate. The courtyard functioned as a convective thermostat and gave protection
from extremes of weather. A dust storm could pass overhead with little effect on the inmates.
The courtyard moderated the extreme effects of the hot summers and freezing winters of
the Indian sub-continent, and averaged out the large diurnal temperature differences. It
varied from being a narrow opening to a large peristyle one in the interior zone of the house,
with perhaps another or more near the entrance and the rear section. The total number of
courtyards in one residence could sometimes be five to six.

Visitors stopped at the outer courtyard where the baithak, sitting place, usually was. Beyond
this was the sequestered zenana, women’s area, around the inner courtyard. In urban areas
where space is limited and only one small courtyard could be constructed the female quarters
were moved up vertically to the upper floor. The courtyards came alive during extended
marriage celebrations and festivals like Holi and Diwali. In a courtyard’s time space there
would also be the admixture of intrigue, flirtation and scandal. With the fading out of
the institution of the joint family, pressure on land and mechanical means of temperature
regulation, this form of residential architecture is naturally falling into disuse.

The courtyard house form in India was not based on blind conformity and there was
tremendous innovation in the design of such homes, known variously in different regions
– haveli in northern India where they were prominent, wada in Maharashtra, nalukettu in
Kerala, rajbari in Bengal and deori in Hyderabad. All had regional variations in design and craft
techniques, using stone, wood, bricks and mortar. The expression haveli is derived from the old
Arabic word haola, meaning partition, and hence the earlier Mughal use of this word to denote
a province. In modern Arabic the word havaleh means encircling, confirming the linkage. Even
similar elements of design have the same nomenclature, like the mashrabiyya (cantilevered
screened balcony) of the Arab courtyard house and the Gujarati haveli.

Over the world variations of the courtyard house range from those in the Arab areas, to the
Mediterranean and Europe. In India, there occurred a sharing in their construction between
Hindu and Muslim designs. Muslim havelis included in their designs the chajja and brackets
and Hindus freely used the cusped arch. Double bangaldar eaves appeared as key architectural
features in Rajasthan and other parts of India. On the whole the Rajput havelis borrowed the
mysterious amorphousness of the earlier Rajput palaces while the Muslim ones abided by the
Islamic distinctness of style, with gradations within these two extremes. The status of the owner
was directly proportional to the residence’s proximity to the ruler’s palace, the number and
size of courtyards enclosed and ornamentation. Rank was evident in their design and certain
symbols were reserved, like that of the elephant in Rajasthan, for the diwan or court minister.
The term haveli is also used for temples of certain sects in Gujarat and pleasure pavilions in the
erstwhile state of Hyderabad.

Courtyard house architecture reflected the style and culture of its time. It was indicative of
the owner’s self-image and aspirations, with a distillation of historical influences. It manifested
itself in degrees, varying from solidity to extreme ornamentation. In Punjab, where safety had
to be ensured against marauders, robustness of construction was the order. Even the rooms
inside would be filled with photographs of ancestors armed to the teeth. However, in the
relative security of a city like Ahmedabad, the traders could indulge in elaborate carved wood
ornamentation in constructing their courtyard houses. The Chettiar merchants adorned their
courtyard houses with solid pillars of Burmese teak procured through their trading links. The
trading community of Shekhawati embarked on a spree of painting frescoes on their havelis
that still stand out. The havelis on the banks of the Ganges were made more for contemplation
and religious sojourns. In places where both wood and stone were used there would be healthy
rivalry between the craftsmen in carving, with motifs of floral scroll-work and human symbols,
birds and animals. Individual complexes would be very evident, as a trader in Shekhawati
would have frescoes splashed on the walls outside while a Rajput would be more restrained.

In urban areas earlier, when social stratification was even more rigid, the layout of a colony
was such that a number of courtyard houses formed a residential cluster, enclosed by a
perimeter wall, having limited entrances. Such enclosures were self-sufficient and would be
barred at night. They had community facilities, wells and places for worship for the residents,
with only the cremation ground outside. All these were maintained by an internal levy. These
clusters are called variously – a peth in Pune, pol in Ahmedabad and a mohalla in north India.
A strong sense of identity prevailed amongst the homogeneous residents of these areas and
sale of property to outsiders was restricted.

The features of the best courtyard houses are similar to the palaces of India, the architecture
of which passed through two phases. The first was during the Mughal period from the late
sixteenth century to the early eighteenth century and the second from the late eighteenth
century to the early twentieth century. During the first stage the Islamic arch was introduced
in the architecture of India. It ended in a great synthesis with Akbar using the Hindu
traebate style at Fatehpur Sikri and the Diwan-e-am at the Rajput palace of Jaipur resembling
a Mughal building. There were also cross-region influences, like the import in northern
India of the bangaldar roof, derived from the Bengali vernacular hut. In the second stage
of palace architecture, Indian rulers tried to out-do each other in building palaces to their
magnificence, ironically only when the British subjugation provided comparative peace for
such building activity, as well as European models. While the first period saw the rise of
monolithic, asymmetrical, structures with a profusion of canopies, connected by gloomy
corridors, like at Udaipur, in the later period came the livelier palaces like those at Jaipur
and Alwar. Arches and beams were used profusely with corbelling techniques, brackets and
balconies. Soon the style became a riot of blends, generally known as Indo-Saracenic, and
other French and Italian imitations.

Unlike palaces, the courtyard house remained an indigenous form though some admixture
of styles did take place, either consciously or because of artisans belonging to different
communities. The anonymous artisans were also the architects, though no paper plans were
made before the construction. The architectural tenets were passed from one generation to
the next and skills sharpened by practical experience from a very young age. The site aspects
and needs of the owner were considered and incorporated in the design and construction.
While the palace stood aloof and dominated its environment, the haveli stood in complete
harmony with its surroundings and fused with the street, there even being a platform or
sitting space next to the entrance. The house activities spilled out on to the streets through
the courtyard. There was the daily interaction with peddlers, weavers, dyers and traveling
artisans. The zamindar, cultivator, was the patron and supporter of the rural craftsmen and
menials. Village musicians and religious mendicants stood at the threshold and sang at the
top of their voices. Genealogists and sycophant bards entered the courtyard to extol the
virtues of the occupant’s ancestors. Barbers carried on their work inside, also carrying gossip
from one ear to another. Nat acrobats were admitted into the courtyard to perform, along with
jugglers, magicians and snake charmers.

In the exterior façade of a courtyard house the base plane is generally above street level to
mark the transition. A depressed plane threshold is rare, as it would let in dust and rainwater.
However, there is no edge definition with adjoining structures and this gives a cluster of
courtyard houses a certain symmetry and rhythm. The threshold is a significant element in
its design and on special occasions rituals and ceremonies are held there. The entrance is
broader in villages, as compared to cities, so that bullock-carts and tractors can enter easily. The
degree of enclosure is ancillary to the local climate and requirements of minimum light and
circulation of air, and the size and location of openings correspondingly designed. The extent
of visual interaction that could be allowed between the interior of the home with the street
depended on social norms.

The courtyard of existing structures is invariably square or rectangular. The circulation space
is well ordered by corridors and galleries, and subtly controls the privacy of the dwelling. The
entry to a courtyard might be through a right-angled entrance, thus preventing direct view
except through a small, screened, aperture. The size of the courtyard, orientation and height of
the surrounding structures are important considerations for its climate control features. Thus it
is narrow to maintain a shaded area in summer and yet wide enough to receive the winter sun.
It might have eaves and screens along its sides to protect the verandah, besides the auspicious
tulsi shrub and climbers. In arid areas the courtyard was also used for collecting and storing
scarce rain-water. There could also be, though rarely, a first floor level gallery connecting the
opposite long sides of the courtyard.

Convective circuits from the courtyard regulated the climate in the entire house. These were
aided by wind scoops on the roof that caught the breeze and propelled it down a shaft, at the
end of which was a layer of khas. The scoops on the roof were at a considerable height, thus
decreasing the entry of dust. Water pots were kept in their air circuit for cooling. Often the
windows in the rooms opened into the scoop shaft for ventilating, though at different heights
for maintaining privacy amongst the rooms. At night cool air came down the courtyard and
flushed the stale air in the rooms. The high ceilings of the rooms aided in keeping them cool in
summer as the angle subtended by the roof to the floor is less from a high ceiling than that by
a lower ceiling. Also, high ceiling rooms have a greater volume of air which remains fresh for
a longer time as compared to smaller volumes of air in smaller rooms, and thus manage with
less aeration when outside temperatures are in the extremes. In towns the narrow streets with
parallel multi-storeyed structures and common adjoining partitions further prevent the vertical
walls from heating up and winding streets make the wind offload its sand.

The usual height of a courtyard house ranges from two to five floors. Window openings
can be from the inside quarters into the courtyards, or from the inside to the street outside,
though at ground floor levels such openings to the street are few. These openings are like
one-way mirrors, to see outside without being seen with the help of screens and chik (reed)
curtains, and are in the form of plain or bay windows and cradle balconies, called jharokha
or mashrabiyya in western India. In particular, the jharokha is one of the most interesting
elements of the Indian haveli. It provides a private sitting area above the street, catching the
summer breeze as well as the winter sun. It lets in indirect light into the nooks and corners of
the rooms and ventilates the building more effectively than a simple window. Often a series
of jharokhas cantilever out progressively, above each other, adding to the floor area as well as
shading the street below.

The use of space in a haveli is generally variable and overlaps, unlike the fixed demarcations
in modern houses. The functions of the rooms are loosely defined and interchangeable.
In hot summers the cool roof could be the sleeping area while in winter it could be one of
the snug rooms. Even though modern levels of privacy were not there, an informal code
existed like demarcating different level terraces to give some privacy for a newly wed pair.
The terraces also have an open shelter at one end and if it started raining at night the light
wooden cots can be quickly dragged under it. The sunny courtyard could be the sitting area
on cold winter days and, on summer afternoons, the cool rooms. Only a few areas are rigidly
defined, like the kitchen or the prayer room.

Means permitting, an enclosure of space as a courtyard was the ambition of every dwelling
and this form exists in some variation or another all over the sub-continent. However, the
typically planned courtyard structure, whose physical design and existence complemented
the society of its times and the climate, was essentially a feature of the plains, starting from
the foothills of the Himalayas. In undivided India this region was mainly Punjab, the United
Provinces, Bihar, parts of Bengal and then down to Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra,
Madhya Pradesh and parts of southern India. The promoters and inhabitants of such
structures were the local chieftains, court ministers, aristocrats, rich merchants, landlords and
traders. The northern belt of this haveli region included the great cities of Amritsar, Lahore,
Delhi, Varanasi and Lucknow. In such pre-eminent cities, unfortunately, not much remains
of the grandness of such residences and they are dilapidated, carved up by heirs and even
a few pristine examples are difficult to come by. The semi-urban and rural regions of the
north still have courtyard homes in use. In the eastern parts of India and the former state of
Hyderabad such residential structures do not survive in as great a density as in the northern
and western parts of India  &#128997;
