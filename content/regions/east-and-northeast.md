West Bengal in eastern India is the land of the ubiquitous bangla hut that went on to
influence mainstream Hindu and Mughal architecture all over India. It is doubtful if any
other architectural feature anywhere in the world has been so widely adapted as this simple
bangla or bangaldar hut. Complete architectural structures have been adapted to this graceful
form, in whole or in parts, like bangaldar roofs and eaves.

The bangla hut roof was earlier made of split bamboo mats, bonded with mud and covered
with thatch or straw, which has now been replaced with corrugated iron sheets. Internally,
bamboo is used for support and the top is curved with overhanging sides for quick runoff for
the heavy rains in that region, as well as for protection against the sun. Typically the eaves
are also curved and deeper at the corners. Hardly any pure bangaldar huts remain today and
illustrated in this work are black and white photographs of some such earlier huts from the
archives of the Anthropological Survey of India, Kolkata. The present country huts of Bengal
have not only switched over to corrugated sheets for the curvilinear roof, but have even
become double-storeyed, with a verandah on the upper floor, though the characteristic slopes
of the roof and walls still remain.

Not many traditional houses exist in Kolkata and predominantly visible is the typical western
facade, influenced by the British. However, some features of vernacular architecture are still
there, like courtyards and bangaldar hut forms.

The vernacular styles of residential structures in the north-east Indian states have a great variety
due to the large number of tribes and communities in each state, with different religions,
beliefs and social norms.

The religions in that region range from tribal animistic to Hinduism,
Buddhism and Christianity, with the features of the houses attuned to the local weather, physical
requirements and preferences. The typical vernacular forms range from huts to large houses
made of stone, wood and thatch, with some like the Naga huts having surface decoration
and carvings on the wood according to their beliefs and traditions. A large number of the
tribals from the states in north-east India also have youth dormitories for teenage children of
the village that are an essential part of their culture. Many of the traditional styles are already extinct and photographs of representative structures have been sourced from the archives of the
Anthropological Survey of India, including some tree houses

{{<blockquote position="left">}}different tribes of Arunachal Pradesh have designs for dwellings depending on the tribe’s
preferences, needs and local materials available – ranging from small huts to the huge structures{{</blockquote>}} In this eastern region of India are the most primitive tribals of India, the Bondas of Koraput.
They use slash and burn methods and build their huts in clearings on hillsides. Their
dwellings are frugal but even in their simplicity they are aware of the use of colour and basic
patterns to break up the empty spaces on their mud walls, with locally available mineral
colours. The roof material of their huts is thatch.

The different tribes of Arunachal Pradesh have designs for dwellings depending on the tribe’s
preferences, needs and local materials available – ranging from small huts to the huge structures
of the Galo tribe and the stone houses of the Monpa tribe around Tawang. The Apa Tani of
Arunachal Pradesh have their huts on high stilts as their areas get flooded with water in the
monsoons. The larger stone houses have common working areas and multi-purpose rooms.

The largest variety of huts is that of the different Naga tribes, in the areas of Nagaland and
parts of Manipur. There are sixty-six such tribes and each tribe has its distinct lifestyle and
residence design, with symbols and motifs of their tribe, a good number of which are illustrated.
Similarly the other regions have their own hut designs like in Manipur and other areas of
north-east India.

The predominant style in Assam and Meghalaya is like the Khasi structures, made on stilts to
provide protection from heavy downpours in the high rainfall area. They are made with wood
planks and partitions of woven bamboo splits. In the plains of Assam the bamboo woven mats
are given an adobe coating and used. Earlier, before government food supply shops came into
being, the villagers maintained granaries separate from their huts to discourage vermin which
were attracted to the cooking of food in a residential hut with human residents.
