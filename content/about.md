A graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K), he was formerly in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) where his positions exposed him to a multitude of cultural and social issues, including tradition-modernity conflicts. One posting of his was directly related to the revival of crafts and weaves of Gujarat. He is a firm believer in the essential role of appropriate technology in India and the need for the revival of congruous traditional skills. Currently he is an advisor to the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH)), at New Delhi.

## The Author Acknowledges&hellip;

I am indebted to all the house owners and residents who allowed me inside their abodes and permitted me to take and publish the photographs. This is all the more relevant as some photographs included in this work were taken many years ago and, sadly, a good number of the houses illustrated are no longer in existence. Had it not been for their generosity many buildings and their construction techniques would have gone unrecorded for posterity.

My amazement never ceases at the wonderful skills and hard work of the many anonymous artisans who built these structures. The labour of love that has gone into the detail of some of the buildings is incredible. I hope this book will help in remembering and promoting their architecture and construction methods, to whatever extent possible.
