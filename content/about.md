Tejinder S. Randhawa (seen here with his wife) has been passionately studying various dimensions of Indian culture and heritage for several decades and has written acclaimed lavishly illustrated books on subjects like courtyard houses (The Indian Courtyard House), nomadic tribes (The Last Wanderers), Sikh arts (Images of a Heritage), Kachchh (The Last Frontier) and on Indian silk (A Critical Study of the Indian Silk Sector).

Apart from the present book, the future titles in his Visual Compendium of Indian Heritage Series are Structural Elements and Spaces in Indian Architecture; The Visual Art History of the Female Form, Eroticism and Fashion in India; Tropical and Himalayan Flowering Trees of India, South and South-East Asia; Strands of Heritage – Silk Textiles of India, 19th Century Onwards; and Textiles and Ornamentation in Indian Mural Traditions, including Ajanta caves. He has published papers on the use of appropriate technology in water conservation and given talks on Indian traditional residential architecture and textiles.

A graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K), he was formerly in the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) where his positions exposed him to a multitude of cultural and social issues, including tradition-modernity conflicts. One posting of his was directly related to the revival of crafts and weaves of Gujarat. He is a firm believer in the essential role of appropriate technology in India and the need for the revival of congruous traditional skills. Currently he is an advisor to the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH)), at New Delhi.

### The Author Acknowledges&hellip;
I am indebted to all the house owners and residents who allowed me inside their abodes and
permitted me to take and publish the photographs. This is all the more relevant as some
photographs included in this work were taken many years ago and, sadly, a good number of
the houses illustrated are no longer in existence. Had it not been for their generosity many
buildings and their construction techniques would have gone unrecorded for posterity.

My amazement never ceases at the wonderful skills and hard work of the many anonymous
artisans who built these structures. The labour of love that has gone into the detail of some
of the buildings is incredible. I hope this book will help in remembering and promoting their
architecture and construction methods, to whatever extent possible.

Grateful acknowledgements to C.K. Koshy, Prof. Dinesh Mehta, V.P. Baligar, Debashish
Nayak, Anu Mridul, Didi Contractor in Kangra, Tomo Gamlin in Arunachal Pradesh for
their help, Brijender S. Dua of Grafiniti for book design inputs and P.N. Dalwadi, Surendra
and Bhramagna Patel for Ektachrome E-6 processing in the days before digital photography

I got generous help from my colleagues in the Indian Administrative Service, in particular
K.J. Alphons, Ravindra Singh and S. Ramasundaram, for which I am grateful. For
sponsoring the book thanks are due to Gerard da Cunha of Architecture Autonomous – who
also helped me in photographing houses in Goa.

The author would also like to thank the Housing and Urban Development Corporation
and its Human Settlement Management Institute for partially supporting the project;
Indian National Trust For Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) and Seema, Nandita and
Poonam in its Knowledge Centre at the head office in New Delhi; the Anthropological
Survey of India for allowing the use of historical black and white photographs of selected
residential structures from their collections; Raja Dinkar Kelkar Museum in Pune and
the various vernacular architecture museums in India for permission to take and publish
detailed photographs of vernacular structures displayed – the late Vijaynath Shenoy and
his remarkable Hasta Shilpa Heritage Village in Manipal, Deborah Thiagarajan and
Dakshinachitra near Chennai, Museum of Man in Bhopal and Kisama Heritage Village in
Nagaland.
